      <h1 id="title">My Discord bots:</h1>
      <p id="text">
        One of the main things I like to make from time to time is Discord bots, Discord is an online platform that is widely used to create communities for any type of people and their interests like gaming, artwork, programming, etc...<br>
        It is home to over 250 million users and millions of gulids that are owned by the community, Discord also provides an API that allows programmers like myself to easily create bot accounts that users can interact with, this can be used to make bots of all kinds, some common examples of bots tend to include moderation bots, music bots, in chat game bots and Economy bots just to name a few.<br>
        With the wide popularity bot making has it is common that most programming languages have a form of library that allow you to make bots easily, most of the time this means that you dont have to learn a whole new programming language for it as chances are the langages you already know have a library in place to support it.<br>
        Personally I prefer to use a Python library known as <code>discord.py</code> that you can find information on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">here!</a><br>
        Below you will find a full list of Discord bots I have created/am working on.

          <h1>Yuri PyBot</h1>
          <p>
            <span id="bolden">Yuri PyBot</span> was the first discord bot I worked on, originaly called "stshrewsburyBot" I wanted to make a simple bot that had a wide variety of features that are simple and easy to use.<br>
            I am still activly working on <span id="bolden">Yuri PyBot</span> trying to add more and more features that I think fits well into a discord bot without making the bot to complex.<br>
            <span id="bolden">Yuri PyBot</span> is also hosted and you are able to interact with it via Discord by inviting it to your very own guild.<br>
            I don't currently plan on making this an open source project as of right now but I may consider it in the future. <span id="small_text">(Not promising anything though...)</span>
