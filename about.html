      <p id="text">
        <span id="bolden">stshrewsbury.dev</span> is a website that is made and owned by me, Steven Shrewsbury.<br>
        Originally I was going to use this site to just link basic things like social media and have links to my old scratch games at the time but since then a lot has changed, I started college and decided it would be a much more useful purpose for this site if I turned it into a portfolio style site.<br>
        This way I can not only showcase some of my work but also use it to host some of the other things I originally planned but on separate parts of this domain as to not clutter the main one to much (Links to all that should be on the navigation located at the top of the website under the "projects" tab).<br><br>
        The main website along with some of the subdomain websites I have were made using plain HTML and CSS code without the use of any third party programs like bootstrap studio or Adobe Dreamweaver, this was mainly since I wanted the challenge of making a website from scratch with just plain code. <span id="small_text">(As well as that the price of those programs are rather high for a college student who does programming as a hobby)</span><br><br>
        <span id="small_text">Fun fact, I hid a few "easter eggs" around this website if anyones interested in trying to find them, good luck if you do!</span>
